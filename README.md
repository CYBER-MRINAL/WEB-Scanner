# WEB-Scanner

## Project Overview
The **WEB-Scanner** is a sophisticated, Python-based tool meticulously designed to automate the detection and analysis of critical security vulnerabilities in web applications. This project serves as an essential resource for security professionals, developers, and penetration testers who are committed to proactively identifying, assessing, and remediating security risks, thereby fortifying the integrity and resilience of their applications against an ever-evolving threat landscape.

- **Main Thing**: This script create a *output* named folder autometically and save the *log & text* file in itself. It also ask for the name of that files. User can scan multiple website in it and they don't mixed up in the *output* folder. This script give you upto 85% accuracy on scan.

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment
The scanner employs a multi-faceted approach to identify a wide array of vulnerabilities, including:

- **SQL Injection**: Utilizes advanced payloads and techniques to detect vulnerabilities that allow attackers to manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or data manipulation.
  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Implements various attack vectors to identify injection points for malicious scripts, assessing both reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities with precision.

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Evaluates the application’s defenses against unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users, including token validation checks and session management vulnerabilities.

- **File Inclusion**: Conducts thorough assessments for Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities, analyzing server responses for sensitive data exposure and potential remote code execution.

- **Command Injection**: Tests for vulnerabilities that enable attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server, utilizing a diverse range of payloads to assess the application’s command execution capabilities.

### Intelligent Reporting and Remediation Guidance
The scanner generates detailed, structured reports that include:

- **Vulnerability Type**: Clear classification of the detected issue, including Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores for risk assessment.

- **Location**: Specific URL or endpoint where the vulnerability was identified, along with the parameters involved.

- **Description**: In-depth explanation of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and recommended remediation strategies, including code snippets and best practices.

- **Severity Level**: Risk categorization (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on the potential impact on the application and its users, with prioritization for remediation.

### Robust Logging and Audit Trail
The tool maintains a comprehensive log of all scanning activities, including timestamps, detected vulnerabilities, and any errors encountered. This feature is crucial for compliance audits, post-scan reviews, and forensic analysis.

### Modular and Extensible Architecture
Designed with a modular architecture, the scanner allows for easy extension and integration of additional vulnerability checks. Users can customize the scanner to suit specific testing requirements or to incorporate new vulnerability detection techniques, leveraging a plugin system for third-party contributions.
